We run a busy farm with seasonal festivals. We rented several deluxe sink units for our fall festival, and they were perfect. Having the handwashing inside the unit was a huge plus, especially with all the kids and sticky food. The portable restroom rental prices were fair, and the service was friendly and professional. We'll be using them every year.<h2> - Maria G
